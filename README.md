## 📖 Overview

This project is a **fully responsive personal portfolio website** built with **React 19** and **Vite**, designed to deliver a seamless user experience across both mobile and desktop platforms. It features a **modern, clean UI** styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and includes engaging **interactive animations** powered by libraries like `react-parallax-tilt`, `framer-motion`, and `react-typing-effect`.

The application is structured using **reusable, modular components**, with prop validation handled via `prop-types`. It supports **client-side routing** using `react-router-dom`, enabling smooth navigation between sections. The **typewriter-effect** library is used for dynamic text animations, while **EmailJS** integration powers a real-time, working contact form. Additionally, **react-toastify** provides non-intrusive toast notifications for user feedback.

Optimized for both **performance** and **scalability**, this portfolio serves as a professional and visually engaging platform to showcase my **skills**, **experience**, **projects**, and **educational background**.
